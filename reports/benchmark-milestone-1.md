# Benchmark Milestone 1 Report

Date: 2026-01-23 (updated with memory and stress metrics)

## Summary

First performance benchmark milestone - measuring quench on itself (dogfooding).
All performance targets have been exceeded.

## Environment

- Hardware: Apple M3 Max
- OS: Darwin 25.2.0
- Rust: 1.92.0 (ded5c06cf 2025-12-08)
- quench commit: 378d701

## Results

### Dogfooding (quench on quench)

| Mode | Target | Measured | Status |
|------|--------|----------|--------|
| fast | <1s | 18.97ms | PASS |
| fast (json) | <1s | 18.98ms | PASS |
| ci | <5s | 3.20ms | PASS |

### Individual Checks

| Check | Target | Measured | Status |
|-------|--------|----------|--------|
| cloc | <200ms | 14.50ms | PASS |
| escapes | <200ms | 14.47ms | PASS |
| agents | <100ms | 14.21ms | PASS |

### Fixture Benchmarks

| Fixture | Files | Lines | Time |
|---------|-------|-------|------|
| bench-small | ~10 | ~500 | 9.77ms |
| bench-medium | ~50 | ~5k | 9.78ms |
| bench-large | ~200 | ~20k | 11.32ms |
| bench-deep | ~40 | ~1k | 10.19ms |
| bench-large-files | ~5 | ~5k | 9.53ms |

### CLI Baseline

| Operation | Measured |
|-----------|----------|
| cli_startup (--help) | 3.39ms |
| version_check (--version) | 6.72ms |

### Memory Usage

| Mode | Target | Measured | Status |
|------|--------|----------|--------|
| fast | <100MB | 11.4 MB | PASS |
| ci | <500MB | 6.8 MB | PASS |

Memory measured using `/usr/bin/time -l` (maximum resident set size).

### Stress Test Results

| Fixture | Files | Target | Measured | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|----------|--------|
| stress-huge-files | 50K | <30s | 2.05s | PASS |
| stress-monorepo | 5K | <10s | 0.21s | PASS |
| stress-large-file | 5×5MB | <5s | 0.30s | PASS |

Stress fixtures generated with `./scripts/fixtures/generate-stress-fixtures`.

## Observations

1. **Exceptional Performance**: All benchmarks complete well under their targets.
   - Fast mode at ~19ms is 50x faster than the 1s target
   - CI mode at ~3.2ms is 1500x faster than the 5s target
   - Individual checks at ~14ms are 7-14x faster than targets

2. **Consistent Scaling**: Benchmark fixtures show minimal time increase from
   small (~10 files) to large (~200 files), indicating efficient file walking
   and parallel processing.

3. **CLI Overhead**: The ~3ms startup time shows minimal CLI initialization
   overhead, leaving room for actual work.

4. **No Bottlenecks Identified**: At these performance levels, there are no
   obvious optimization targets for this milestone.

5. **Memory Efficiency**: Both fast and CI modes use minimal memory (~7-11MB),
   well under the 100MB and 500MB targets respectively.

6. **Stress Test Performance**: Edge-case workloads (50K files, 5K workspace,
   5MB files) all complete in under 3 seconds, demonstrating robust scaling.

## Baseline Established

Criterion baselines saved as `milestone-1` for regression tracking.

```bash
# To compare future runs against this baseline:
cargo bench --bench dogfood -- --baseline milestone-1
cargo bench --bench check -- --baseline milestone-1
cargo bench --bench baseline -- --baseline milestone-1
```

## Infrastructure Added (Checkpoint 6E)

1. **Memory profiling**: External measurement via `/usr/bin/time -l`
2. **Stress fixtures**: `./scripts/fixtures/generate-stress-fixtures` creates 50K/5K/5MB test fixtures
3. **E2E stress benchmarks**: Added to `benches/stress.rs` benchmark group
4. **CI benchmark workflow**: `.github/workflows/bench.yml` for regression detection
5. **Profiling guide**: `docs/profiling.md` with instructions for time/memory profiling

## Next Steps

1. Monitor for performance regressions as features are added
2. Consider heap profiling with jemalloc if memory usage grows
3. Tune CI regression threshold (currently 10% via Criterion defaults)
4. Add more language-specific stress fixtures as adapters are added
