## Usage in Specs

```rust
use crate::prelude::*;

#[test]
fn cloc_passes_on_simple_project() {
    check("cloc").on("rust-simple").passes();
}

#[test]
fn escapes_fails_on_unwrap() {
    check("escapes")
        .on("violations")
        .fails()
        .stdout_has("escapes.rs");
}
```

## Fixture Details

### shell-scripts/

Shell-only project for testing shell-specific checks.

### mixed/

Combined Rust and shell project for testing multi-language detection.

## New Fixtures for File Walking

### bench-deep/

Deeply nested directory structure (120 levels) for testing depth limits.

- Generated by `scripts/fixtures/generate-bench-deep.sh`
- File at level 50: should be scanned with default limit
- File at level 120: should be skipped with default limit (100)
- Tests iterative traversal (recursive would stack overflow)

### gitignore-test/

Tests `.gitignore` file exclusion during file walking.

- Has standard `.gitignore` patterns
- `target/` and `vendor/` directories should be ignored
- `*.generated.rs` files should be ignored
- `src/lib.rs` should be scanned

### symlink-loop/

Tests symlink loop detection.

- Contains `loop -> .` symlink pointing to itself
- Created by `scripts/fixtures/setup-symlink-fixtures.sh`
- Should complete without hanging
- `src/lib.rs` should still be scanned

### custom-ignore/

Tests custom ignore patterns from `quench.toml`.

- Has `[project.ignore]` section with custom patterns
- Tests `*.snapshot`, `testdata/`, `**/fixtures/**` patterns
- `src/lib.rs` should be scanned, patterns should be ignored

## Regenerating Fixtures

Most fixtures are static. Some require generation:

```bash
# Generate oversized file
./scripts/fixtures/generate-oversized.sh > tests/fixtures/violations/src/oversized.rs

# Generate deeply nested structure
./scripts/fixtures/generate-bench-deep.sh

# Create symlinks (after clone)
./scripts/fixtures/setup-symlink-fixtures.sh

# Or run all fixture setup at once:
./scripts/fixtures/setup-test-fixtures.sh
```

## Adding New Fixtures

1. Create directory under `tests/fixtures/`
2. Add minimal `quench.toml` (or none for default behavior test)
3. Add source files appropriate for the test scenario
4. Document in this README
5. Add specs that use the fixture
