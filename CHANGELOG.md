## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0]

### Added

#### Commands
- `quench init` command with language and agent auto-detection
- `quench report` command with JSON, HTML, and Markdown output formats
- `--timing` flag for performance breakdown analysis

#### Behavior
- **Ratcheting**: Quality metrics can improve but not regress. Compares current metrics against `.quench/baseline.json`. Use `--fix` to update baseline when metrics improve.

#### Checks
- **git check**: Conventional commit message validation with `.gitmessage` template generation
- **git check**: Agent documentation check for AI coding assistants
- **git check**: Skip merge commits option (`skip_merge`)
- **tests check**: Source/test correlation with commit-scope checking
- **tests check**: JS/TS placeholder detection (`test.todo()`, `it.skip()` patterns)
- **docs check**: Table of contents validation with explicit `toc`/`no-toc` annotations
- **docs check**: Specs index validation modes (toc, linked, auto)
- **docs check**: Markdown link validation
- **docs check**: Source-based area detection for commit checking
- **placeholders check**: Detection of placeholder tests across languages
- **cloc check**: Per-language check levels
- **policy check**: Per-language policy enforcement

#### Adapters
- JavaScript/TypeScript adapter with project detection and escape patterns
- Go adapter improvements with profile support

#### Configuration
- Agent profiles and ratcheting config in `quench init`
- Typo suggestions for unknown check names
- `cfg_test_split` modes (count, require, off)
- Scope field added to Violation output

### Changed

- Migrated git operations from subprocess calls to git2 library (6x speedup)
- Optimized warm cache performance with memory-mapped file reading
- Improved tests correlation check with O(1) lookups
- Enhanced docs check with lazy regex and parallel processing
- Replaced `--profile` with `--with` for `quench init`
- Removed `[workspace]` config namespace, consolidated into `[project]`

### Fixed

- Handle deleted files in staged/changed file detection
- Multi-line attribute parsing for `cfg(test)` and `allow`/`expect`
- Edge cases in tests correlation check
- Ratchet message output, decimal precision, and unused parameter handling
- `.cjs`/`.cts` extension support in JavaScript adapter

### Performance

- git2 migration provides 6x speedup over subprocess calls
- Memory-mapped file reading reduces allocations
- Lazy regex compilation in docs check
- Parallel processing for docs validation
- O(1) lookups in tests correlation
- Fast-path optimizations in JavaScript adapter
- Performance budget enforcement and profiling infrastructure
