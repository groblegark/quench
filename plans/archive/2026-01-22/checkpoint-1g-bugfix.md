# Checkpoint 1G: Bug Fixes - CLI Runs

**Root Feature:** `quench-ba7f`

## Overview

Verification checkpoint to ensure no bugs were introduced during previous refactors (1C), performance work (1E), or cleanup (1F). This checkpoint runs the full test suite, verifies all specs pass, checks for edge cases, and confirms clippy cleanliness.

**Current Status:** All checks pass. The codebase is in a healthy state with:
- 112 unit tests passing
- 77 spec tests passing (4 ignored with TODO markers for future work)
- Clippy clean (no warnings)
- Bootstrap checks pass (file sizes, test conventions)
- `cargo audit` and `cargo deny` pass

## Dependencies

No new dependencies required. This is a verification-only checkpoint.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Run Full Test Suite

**Goal:** Verify all tests pass without regressions.

**Tasks:**
1. Run unit tests:
   ```bash
   cargo test --all
   ```

2. Run spec tests specifically:
   ```bash
   cargo test -p quench --test specs
   ```

3. Document any failures and their root causes.

**Expected Results:**
- 112 unit tests: PASS
- 77 spec tests: PASS (4 ignored with TODO markers)

**Verification:** All tests pass.

---

### Phase 2: Verify Clippy Clean

**Goal:** Confirm no new warnings introduced during refactoring.

**Tasks:**
1. Run clippy with strict warnings:
   ```bash
   cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
   ```

2. Review any warnings for:
   - Unused variables/imports
   - Dead code
   - Unnecessary allocations
   - Potential bugs (e.g., suspicious patterns)

**Expected Results:** No warnings.

**Verification:** Clippy passes with `-D warnings`.

---

### Phase 3: Check Edge Cases

**Goal:** Verify edge cases weren't broken during refactoring.

**Categories to verify:**

| Category | Test Coverage | Status |
|----------|---------------|--------|
| Empty directories | `walker::tests::handles_empty_directory` | PASS |
| Symlink loops | `file_walking::file_walking_detects_symlink_loops` | PASS |
| Nested gitignore | `file_walking::file_walking_respects_nested_gitignore` | PASS |
| Large files | `reader::tests::rejects_oversized_file` | PASS |
| Parallel/sequential walker | `walker::tests::parallel_and_sequential_produce_same_files` | PASS |
| Config discovery | `discovery::tests::*` (6 tests) | PASS |
| Check failure isolation | `runner::tests::runner_isolates_panicking_check` | PASS |
| Check enable/disable flags | `checks::*` spec tests | PASS |

**Tasks:**
1. Review test output for any flaky tests
2. Verify performance-sensitive tests are consistent
3. Confirm walker produces identical results in parallel and sequential modes

**Verification:** All edge case tests pass consistently.

---

### Phase 4: Run Full Make Check

**Goal:** Execute complete verification pipeline.

**Tasks:**
1. Run full check suite:
   ```bash
   make check
   ```

2. This executes:
   - `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
   - `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`
   - `cargo test --all`
   - `cargo build --all`
   - `./scripts/bootstrap` (file sizes, test conventions)
   - `cargo audit`
   - `cargo deny check`

**Expected Results:** All checks pass.

**Verification:** `make check` completes successfully.

---

### Phase 5: Document & Commit

**Goal:** Record verification results and commit.

**Tasks:**
1. If any fixes were needed, document them
2. Update this plan with final status
3. Commit with verification summary:

```
Checkpoint 1G: Verify test suite passes

Verification Results:
- 112 unit tests: PASS
- 77 spec tests: PASS (4 ignored)
- Clippy: Clean
- Bootstrap: Pass
- Audit/Deny: Pass

No bugs found during verification.
```

**Verification:** Commit pushed, branch ready for merge.

## Key Implementation Details

### Why This Checkpoint Exists

After significant refactoring work (1C-1F), it's important to:
1. Catch any subtle bugs before moving forward
2. Ensure test coverage caught all regressions
3. Verify the codebase is in a releasable state
4. Document the clean baseline for future work

### Tests Intentionally Ignored

The 4 ignored spec tests are not bugs - they have explicit TODO markers:

| Test | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `file_walking_respects_custom_depth_limit` | TODO: Create bench-deep fixture |
| `file_walking_respects_default_depth_limit` | TODO: Create bench-deep fixture |
| `file_walking_uses_iterative_traversal` | TODO: Create bench-deep fixture |
| `file_walking_warns_on_depth_limit_in_verbose` | TODO: Create bench-deep fixture |

These are placeholders for future depth-limit testing with large fixtures.

### What Constitutes a "Bug" for This Checkpoint

- Test failures introduced by refactoring
- Clippy warnings indicating potential issues
- Behavioral changes not covered by tests
- Performance regressions in walker
- Config parsing issues
- Edge case handling failures

### Current State Assessment

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| CLI parsing | Healthy | All flag tests pass |
| Config loading | Healthy | Discovery and parsing work |
| File walking | Healthy | Parallel/sequential modes work |
| Check execution | Healthy | Isolation and continuation work |
| Output formatting | Healthy | JSON and text output correct |
| Error handling | Healthy | Exit codes match spec |

## Verification Plan

1. **Tests pass:** `cargo test --all` completes with 0 failures
2. **Specs pass:** All non-ignored spec tests pass
3. **Clippy clean:** No warnings with `-D warnings`
4. **Bootstrap pass:** File sizes and conventions verified
5. **Full check:** `make check` completes successfully

### Success Criteria

- [x] Full test suite passes (112 unit + 77 spec)
- [x] All specs still pass (no regressions)
- [x] Edge cases verified working
- [x] Clippy clean
- [x] `make check` passes

### Bugs Found & Fixed

**None.** The codebase passed all verification checks without modifications.

This confirms that the previous checkpoints (1C-1F) maintained code quality and test coverage.
