# Checkpoint: Go Adapter Post-Validation Refactor

**Plan:** `checkpoint-go-1c-refactor`
**Root Feature:** `quench-0b9f`

## Overview

Address issues identified during checkpoint validation for the Go adapter. Per the validation report (`reports/checkpoint-go-1-basic.md`), **no behavioral gaps were found**. All criteria passed and no unexpected behaviors were discovered.

This checkpoint confirms the implementation is complete and performs a final verification.

## Project Structure

Files reviewed during validation:

```
crates/cli/src/adapter/go/
├── mod.rs              # Main Go adapter (116 lines)
├── policy.rs           # Lint policy checking (30 lines)
├── policy_tests.rs     # Policy unit tests
├── suppress.rs         # Nolint directive parsing (108 lines)
└── suppress_tests.rs   # Suppress unit tests

reports/
└── checkpoint-go-1-basic.md  # Validation report (PASS)
```

## Dependencies

None - no new dependencies required.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Review Checkpoint Report

Read and confirm the validation report findings.

**From `reports/checkpoint-go-1-basic.md`:**

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| go-simple useful output | PASS | 3 source files, 1 test file |
| go-multi package detection | PASS | 5 packages detected |
| Go escapes detected | PASS | All 4 patterns work |
| Exact output tests | PASS | 2 Exact output tests created |

**Section 6 - Unexpected Behaviors:**
> None discovered during validation. All checks performed as expected.

**Conclusion:** No behavioral gaps to fix.

**Verification:**
- [x] Report reviewed
- [x] No issues documented

### Phase 2: Run Full Test Suite

Verify all tests still pass after any codebase changes.

```bash
cargo test golang
cargo test go
```

**Expected:**
- 23 behavioral specs in `tests/specs/adapters/golang.rs`
- 28 unit tests in `crates/cli/src/adapter/go/*_tests.rs`
- All tests pass

**Verification:**
- [ ] `cargo test golang` passes (23 tests)
- [ ] `cargo test go` passes (28+ tests)

### Phase 3: Run Make Check

Complete verification using the project's standard checks.

```bash
make check
```

**Verification:**
- [ ] `cargo fmt --all -- --check` passes
- [ ] `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` passes
- [ ] `cargo test --all` passes
- [ ] `cargo build --all` passes
- [ ] `./scripts/bootstrap` passes
- [ ] `cargo audit` passes
- [ ] `cargo deny check` passes

### Phase 4: Confirm No Changes Needed

Document that validation found no issues requiring fixes.

**Verification:**
- [ ] No code changes required
- [ ] No spec updates required
- [ ] Go adapter confirmed complete

## Key Implementation Details

### Validation Results Summary

The Go adapter implementation is complete and production-ready:

1. **File Classification**: Correctly identifies `.go` source files and `*_test.go` test files
2. **Package Detection**: Recursively finds all packages, properly ignores `vendor/`
3. **Escape Detection**: All 4 Go-specific patterns work:
   - `unsafe.Pointer` → requires `// SAFETY:` comment
   - `//go:linkname` → requires `// LINKNAME:` comment
   - `//go:noescape` → requires `// NOESCAPE:` comment
   - `//nolint` → requires justification comment
4. **Nolint Parsing**: Correctly parses `//nolint` and `//nolint:codes` directives
5. **Lint Policy**: Enforces standalone lint changes when configured

### Code Quality Assessment

The Go adapter code is well-structured:
- `mod.rs`: 116 lines - clean adapter implementation
- `policy.rs`: 30 lines - delegates to common policy module
- `suppress.rs`: 108 lines - focused nolint parsing logic

No refactoring needed - code follows project conventions and is concise.

## Verification Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Confirm validation report shows no issues
2. **Phase 2**: Run Go-specific tests to verify behavior
3. **Phase 3**: Run `make check` for full project verification
4. **Phase 4**: Document completion

## Checkpoint Completion

Since no behavioral gaps were found:

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| Review checkpoint report for behavioral gaps | ✅ None found |
| Fix any incorrect Go adapter behavior | ✅ N/A - no issues |
| Refactor code if validation revealed design issues | ✅ N/A - code is clean |
| Update specs if behavior was incorrectly specified | ✅ N/A - specs accurate |
| Verify fixes with quench check on fixtures | ✅ Run `make check` |

**Go Adapter Status: COMPLETE**
