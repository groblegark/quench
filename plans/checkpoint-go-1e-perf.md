# Checkpoint Go-1E: Performance - Go Adapter

**Root Feature:** Go Adapter (Dogfooding Milestone 1)

## Overview

Performance review checkpoint for the Go adapter based on benchmark findings from checkpoint-go-1d. The benchmark report (`reports/checkpoint-go-1-perf.md`) confirms **all performance targets are met with excellent margins**:

| Metric | Target | Actual | Margin |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| go-simple warm | < 100ms | 9.8ms | 10x |
| go-multi warm | < 100ms | 10.2ms | 10x |
| GoAdapter::new() | < 100us | 19.9us | 5x |
| End-to-end check | < 1s | ~10ms | 100x |

**Finding: No bottlenecks identified. No optimization work required.**

The Go adapter demonstrates excellent performance characteristics:
- **Fastest adapter creation** among all adapters (19.9µs vs 60-80µs for others)
- **Efficient classification** at 0.062µs per file
- **Linear nolint parsing** at 70ns per line

**Goals:**
1. Verify benchmark findings are reproducible
2. Confirm no regression from baseline
3. Update performance report with final verification
4. Close the performance checkpoint

**Non-Goals:**
- Premature optimization of already-fast code
- Adding complexity for marginal gains
- Major architectural changes

## Dependencies

No new dependencies required. All work uses existing tooling:
- `criterion` - Micro-benchmarking (existing)
- `hyperfine` - End-to-end benchmarking (existing)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Review Benchmark Report

**Goal:** Confirm benchmark findings and identify any areas requiring investigation.

**Steps:**
1. Read `reports/checkpoint-go-1-perf.md` thoroughly
2. Review performance breakdown by category:
   - End-to-end benchmarks (hyperfine)
   - Adapter micro-benchmarks (criterion)
   - Comparison with other adapters
3. Confirm "No bottlenecks identified" conclusion is accurate

**Findings from benchmark report:**

| Category | Assessment |
|----------|------------|
| End-to-end performance | EXCELLENT - ~10ms vs 100ms target |
| Adapter creation | EXCELLENT - 19.9µs, fastest among all adapters |
| File classification | EXCELLENT - 0.062µs per file |
| go.mod parsing | EXCELLENT - 34-43ns (essentially free) |
| Package enumeration | EXCELLENT - < 500µs for all fixtures |
| Nolint parsing | EXCELLENT - 70ns per line, linear scaling |

**Verification:**
```bash
# Read the benchmark report
cat reports/checkpoint-go-1-perf.md
```

**Milestone:** Benchmark report reviewed, no bottlenecks confirmed.

**Status:** [ ] Pending

---

### Phase 2: Validate End-to-End Performance

**Goal:** Re-run end-to-end benchmarks to confirm reproducibility.

**Validation:**
```bash
cargo build --release

# Run end-to-end benchmarks on Go fixtures
hyperfine --warmup 3 --runs 10 \
    './target/release/quench check tests/fixtures/go-simple' \
    './target/release/quench check tests/fixtures/go-multi' \
    './target/release/quench check tests/fixtures/golang/auto-detect'
```

**Expected results (from benchmark report):**
- go-simple: ~9.8ms ± 0.3ms
- go-multi: ~10.2ms ± 0.4ms
- golang/auto-detect: ~9.6ms ± 0.5ms

**Acceptance criteria:**
- All fixtures complete in < 20ms (warm, with margin)
- All fixtures complete in < 100ms (absolute target)
- No significant deviation from baseline

**Milestone:** End-to-end performance validated.

**Status:** [ ] Pending

---

### Phase 3: Confirm Micro-Benchmark Stability

**Goal:** Verify adapter micro-benchmarks are stable.

**Validation:**
```bash
# Run Go adapter benchmarks
cargo bench --bench adapter -- go_

# Expected results:
# go_adapter_creation: ~19.9µs
# go_1k_source: ~62µs (0.062µs/file)
# go_1k_test: ~45µs (0.045µs/file)
```

**Acceptance criteria:**
- GoAdapter::new() < 30µs (50% margin)
- classify() < 0.1µs per file
- No regression from benchmark report

**Milestone:** Micro-benchmarks confirmed stable.

**Status:** [ ] Pending

---

### Phase 4: Update Performance Report

**Goal:** Add final verification section to the performance report.

**Update:** `reports/checkpoint-go-1-perf.md`

Append verification section:

```markdown
## Final Verification (Checkpoint Go-1E)

Verified: YYYY-MM-DD

### Re-run Results

| Fixture | Benchmark (1D) | Verification (1E) | Status |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|--------|
| go-simple | 9.8ms | XXms | STABLE |
| go-multi | 10.2ms | XXms | STABLE |
| golang/auto-detect | 9.6ms | XXms | STABLE |

### Conclusion

Performance verified stable. No optimization required.
Target (<1s) exceeded by 100x margin.
```

**Milestone:** Report updated with verification results.

**Status:** [ ] Pending

---

### Phase 5: Quality Gates

**Goal:** Ensure all quality checks pass.

**Validation:**
```bash
make check
```

This runs:
- `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
- `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`
- `cargo test --all`
- `cargo build --all`
- `./scripts/bootstrap`
- `cargo audit`
- `cargo deny check`

**Milestone:** All quality gates pass.

**Status:** [ ] Pending

## Key Implementation Details

### Why No Optimization Is Needed

The benchmark report demonstrates excellent performance across all metrics:

1. **Process startup dominates** - ~50% of total time
2. **File discovery is I/O-bound** - ~30% of total time
3. **Go adapter adds negligible overhead** - < 1% of total time

The Go adapter is the **fastest among all language adapters** due to:
- Simple pattern set (3 GlobSets: source, test, vendor)
- No regex in hot paths (string iteration for go.mod and nolint)
- Early termination for vendor paths

### Performance Comparison

| Adapter | Creation Time | Classification |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| Go | 19.9µs | 0.062µs/file |
| Generic | 33.9µs | 0.038µs/file |
| Rust | 59.7µs | 0.11µs/file |
| Shell | 78.8µs | 0.043µs/file |

Go adapter creation is 3-4x faster than Rust/Shell due to fewer patterns.

### What Would Warrant Future Investigation

Only investigate performance if:
1. End-to-end time exceeds 100ms on standard fixtures
2. Adapter creation exceeds 100µs
3. Classification exceeds 0.5µs per file
4. User reports performance issues

Current metrics are well below all thresholds.

## Verification Plan

1. **Phase 1 verification:**
   ```bash
   cat reports/checkpoint-go-1-perf.md | head -50
   ```

2. **Phase 2 verification:**
   ```bash

   hyperfine --warmup 3 './target/release/quench check tests/fixtures/go-simple'
   ```

3. **Phase 3 verification:**
   ```bash
   cargo bench --bench adapter -- go_
   ```

4. **Phase 4 verification:**
   ```bash
   # Report updated with verification results
   ```

5. **Phase 5 verification:**
   ```bash
   make check
   ```

## Summary

| Phase | Task | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| 1 | Review benchmark report | [ ] Pending |
| 2 | Validate end-to-end performance | [ ] Pending |
| 3 | Confirm micro-benchmark stability | [ ] Pending |
| 4 | Update performance report | [ ] Pending |
| 5 | Quality gates | [ ] Pending |

## Conclusion

**No bottlenecks were identified in the Go adapter benchmarks.**

All performance targets are met with significant margins:
- End-to-end: 10ms vs 1s target (100x margin)
- Adapter creation: 19.9µs vs 100µs target (5x margin)
- Classification: 0.062µs vs 0.1µs target (1.6x margin)

This checkpoint focuses on **verification rather than optimization**. The Go adapter is production-ready with excellent performance characteristics. The simplicity of Go's file organization (single `.go` extension, clear `_test.go` convention, `vendor/` ignore) translates directly to efficient pattern matching and fast checks.

**Recommendation:** Proceed to next checkpoint. No performance work required.
