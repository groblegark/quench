# Quench Overview

Quench (quality bench) is a fast, configurable quality linting CLI for software projects.

## Problem Statement

Quality checks across projects suffer from:
- **Speed**: Existing checks are too slow, blocking fast iteration
- **Setup time**: Each new project requires copy-pasting and adapting scripts
- **Consistency**: Different projects enforce different standards
- **Agent compatibility**: Checks aren't designed for AI agent consumption

## Design Philosophy

### Agent-First

Quench is designed primarily for consumption by AI coding agents (Claude, Codex, Cursor).
Human developers benefit from the same output, but agents are the primary audience.

This means:
- **Progressive disclosure**: Only surface failures, never passing checks
- **Token efficiency**: Concise output, no verbose explanations
- **Actionable advice**: Each failure includes specific, fixable guidance
- **No instructions**: Advice tells _what_ to fix, not _how_ to approach fixing

### Fast by Design

Performance is a core constraint, not an afterthought:
- **Target**: Sub-second for fast checks on typical projects
- **Acceptable**: A few seconds (1-5s) for full checks
- **Unacceptable**: Anything over 30 seconds

Design decisions prioritize speed: parallel file walking, memory-mapped I/O,
compiled pattern matching, early termination where possible.

### Convention Over Configuration

Quench should work out-of-the-box on most projects with zero configuration:
- Smart defaults for common patterns (src/, test/, *_test.*, etc.)
- Language detection enables language-specific defaults
- Configuration only needed for project-specific conventions

When configuration is needed, it's hierarchical (monorepo-friendly) and minimal.

## Core Capabilities

### Built-in Checks

| Check | Fast | CI | Description |
|-------|------|-----|-------------|
| `cloc` | ✓ | ✓ | Lines of code, file size limits (750 source, 1100 test) |
| `escapes` | ✓ | ✓ | Pattern detection with count/comment/forbid actions |
| `agents` | ✓ | ✓ | Agent file validation (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules, sync) |
| `docs` | ✓ | ✓ | File refs, specs validation + doc correlation (CI) |
| `tests` | ✓ | ✓ | Test correlation (fast) + execution, coverage, time (CI) |
| `git` | ✓ | ✓ | Commit message format validation (disabled by default) |
| `build` | | ✓ | Binary/bundle size + build time (cold/hot) |
| `license` | | ✓ | License header validation and auto-fix (disabled by default) |

### Language Adapters

| Adapter | Capabilities |
|---------|--------------|
| `rust` | `#[cfg(test)]` parsing, cargo integration, llvm-cov coverage |
| `golang` | `*_test.go` detection, go test integration, built-in coverage |
| `javascript` | `*.test.ts` / `*.spec.ts` detection, bundler integration, vitest/jest coverage |
| `shell` | Shellcheck integration, bats test runner |
| `generic` | Glob-based source/test detection, pattern matching |

### Test Runners

Shared across adapters for test time and coverage:
- `cargo`, `bats`, `pytest`, `vitest`, `bun`, `jest`, `go`

See [11-test-runners.md](11-test-runners.md) for details.

### Ratcheting

Prevent quality regressions (enabled by default for coverage and escapes):
- Coverage can't drop
- Escape counts can't increase
- Optional: binary size, compile time, test time

See [04-ratcheting.md](04-ratcheting.md) for details.

## Output Design

### Default: Minimal Failures

```
cloc: FAIL
  src/parser.rs: 812 lines (max: 750)
    Split into smaller modules.

escapes: FAIL
  src/main.rs:47: unsafe block without // SAFETY: comment
    Add a // SAFETY: comment explaining the invariants.
```

### JSON Mode (`-o json`)

```json
{
  "checks": [
    {
      "name": "cloc",
      "passed": false,
      "violations": [
        {
          "file": "src/parser.rs",
          "lines": 812,
          "threshold": 750,
          "advice": "Split into smaller modules."
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Colorization

- TTY detection: colorize if stdout is a terminal
- Agent detection: check `CLAUDE_CODE` or `CODEX` env vars, disable color if set

## Configuration

Single `quench.toml` at project root. Per-package overrides configured inline.

```
project-root/
├── quench.toml              # Single config file (optional)
├── crates/
│   ├── cli/                 # No config here - use overrides in root
│   └── core/
```

Per-package and per-module behavior defined in root config via `[check.*.package.package_name]`.

## Modes

### Fast Mode (default)

Quick checks suitable for frequent runs:
- `cloc`: LOC counting with file size limits
- `escapes`: Escape hatch detection
- `agents`: Agent file validation (CLAUDE.md, .cursorrules)
- `docs`: Specs validation (structure, index, sections)
- `tests`: Test correlation (with `--staged` or `--base`)

### CI Mode (`--ci`)

Full checks with multiple behavior changes:

**Enables slow checks:**
- `docs` correlation (feature commits need docs, if enabled)
- `license` headers (if enabled)
- `build` metrics (binary/bundle size, build times)
- Coverage collection
- Test times (total/avg/max)

**Changes behavior:**
- Full file scanning (no early termination)
- Complete violation counts (not limited)
- Metrics storage to baseline file or git notes

### Fix Mode (`--fix`)

Auto-fix what can be fixed:
- CLAUDE.md / .cursorrules sync
- Ratchet baseline updates (when metrics improve)
- License headers (if enabled)
- Report what was fixed, what remains

## Success Criteria

Quench succeeds if:
1. A new project can run `quench check` with zero config and get useful feedback
2. Fast checks complete in under 1 second on a 50k LOC codebase
3. AI agents can parse output and take action without additional prompting
4. Configuration is only needed for project-specific conventions
